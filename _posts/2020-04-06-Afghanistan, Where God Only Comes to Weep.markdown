As a reader, I am assured that once in a lifetime we always wish to meet our favorite writer or the character limned in a novel. To me, Siba Shakib is one, as I always adored her writing, her way of portraying the characters not only the main protagonist but also each detail about the particular situation, place, and circumstances. 



Shakib is an Iranian/German filmmaker, writer, and political activist. She was born and brought up in Tehran, Iran. Shakib also worked as Music Journalist and a Radio Presenter before she came up writing her first international bestseller novel Afghanistan, Where God Only Comes to Weep, was published by Century, London in 2002AD has been translated into 27 different languages and received numerous recognitions and prizes for it including one of renown Peter Surava PEN Prize. This novel is a journey of three hundred and Eleven pages. She had written three novels, Samira and Samir (2005) and ESKANDAR (2009) were her second and third writings subsequently. 

I have had always been fond of the stories where Women are Icons, especially where they stand and fight for themselves. Here the title of the novel articulates itself.  While reading Afghanistan, Where God Only Comes to Weep, I could pair down expression to the essentials with each word and phrases passing more than ever. It firmly depicts the suffering of people who cannot understand how actions taken in the name of God, can be so implacably catastrophic. The story witness the life of Shirin-Gol’s from her early childhood days to, when she is a grandmother. The novel takes you to the journey of Shirin-Gol, her husband and her children travel from Afghanistan to Pakistan’s refugee camp, to Afghanistan, to Iran and back to Afghanistan in an unceasing quest for peaceful survival. They discover humanity only among tyrannizer.

Shirin true to her first name was born as a sweet and charming flower as ninth child of her family. Shirin life was delightful and prosperous until Russians invaded Afghanistan in 1979AD and bombarded her village. She soon started to realize that her country was in real threat as desolation wasn't limited within her home. Shirin- Gol and her family except for her father and brothers who joined the resistance, fled to the capital Kabul, where she starts encountering the daily life struggle due to instability caused indictment of all politicians. She always aspired to become a doctor which she could never attain. She is forced to marry Morad; her husband at early age to pay off her brother's gambling debt. Despite all the adversities and dreadful circumstances for existence, she always prioritized education for her children so that they could have a better chance to live their lives.

Life has its own rules and choices and we have our own but it hardly coincides and neither is the Shirin-Gol situation. As most of the Afghan families, Shirin's family also had to suffer under the Taliban regime, where women are not allowed to work and are captive behind the walls of a house, where children are enforced to beg on streets. Shirin-Gol situations were just as weak as one can ever think. Morad, the only man she ever hoped and relied on becomes addicted to Opium and she couldn't stop it. She lured to sell her young daughter and had to negotiate with her dignity and conscience selling her body in exchange of food and money as most of the helpless Afghani women, just to ensure her children doesn't die of hunger. She endures and never gives up hope in the world where an anomaly is ethics; in which social exertion is determined by murder, rape, humiliation, poverty, disease, and despair.

In this novel, one can find upraise of a woman from the razed state after all the hardships and struggle for a living. The gallantry of a woman against all hostile conditions and finding the civilized value of love, caring, sharing and happiness, when one is not even sure of seeing tomorrow’s dawn, where life is travail but with the smile on face, courage in heart and friendship in the eyes, one can conquer any exception. As said, courage overpowers the fear.  It’s a story of separation and reunions followed by lot of heartbreaking and grievous events. One can find many Shirin-Gol in the streets of Afghanistan.

A struggle worth reading and knowing life can be beautiful if the hope and courage lie in one's heart

I"<p>Dry your tears, my friends and raise your heads as the flowers raise their crowns to greet the dawn. Falling for words is obvious, specifically when it comes from world-renowned Lebanese – American writer, poet, visual artist, and Lebanese nationalist Khalil Gibran.</p>

<p>Gibran was born on January 6, 1883, in the town of Bsharri in the rugged Northern terrain of Mount Lebanon to Khalil Gibran and Kamila Gibran. Gibran Khalil Gibran his full Arabic name was also called Kahlil Gibran Jr. during his schooling days by teachers as reported as he and his father shared the same name. An aboriginal of what is now Lebanon, he immigrated with his family to The United States at his Juvenile age, where he studied Art and began his literary career, writing both in English and Arabic.  </p>

<p>Khalil Gibran writings shook the ruling establishment as a result of which he was banished from his own country. It was not the Lebanese government that ostracized Gibran. It was their master, the Turkish Sultan who was alarmed by the rebellious poet and frighten by the exordium of free ideas onto the Orthodox Middle Eastern society. Therefore, He was regarded as a Literary and political rebel in the Arabic world.</p>

<p>Being attached to books, one surely has its own share of love for poetry and Philosophy. I consider good poetry or Poet is someone who can put the whole bit emotions and sentiments in a few lines of a poem which can’t be explained in an entire story. One can commune and find their spirit in Gibran’s poetries. He knew how to recreate with expressions legendarily. The aesthetic words of the Gibran have graced everything from greeting cards to inspirational wall hangings and corporate motivational literature for the past eight decades. Among many, his most praised writings beside The Prophet are Broken Wings, The Madman and The Garden of Prophet.Whenever I feel gloomy, his extravagant words help me soothe my heart and charge it with courage and wisdom.

As wonderful as this is, there is much more to Gibran. Most of us know him as a visionary voice of comfort, love, and tolerance. His article of faith is commendable, as he believed in the existence of the soul and its rebirth but not according to the doctrine of Nirvana, ‘Space and matter are in God.’ Gibran had said, ‘we are the breath and the fragrance of God.’ For him the life is related to the common word for breath in the Semitic languages- a breath of life that is found in all of nature and throughout the universe. Whether in biblical Hebrew, the Aramaic of Jesus, or the literary Arabic in which Gibran wrote many of his early works, life means the energy and vitality or the way someone or something expresses this life, not the way he, she or it appears.</p>

<p>Reading the Wisdom of Khalil Gibran is a true bliss. For me, Gibran writings are naturalistic and insightful but one can also discover satirical sarcasm in expressions presented his books. Each page has its own share of surprise and perceptivity in it. I would say, to all the Readers and Poetry lovers this one is a must read. Concluding my composition with one of my fave quote from this book is, ‘he who reveals secrets are considered a fool; silence and secrecy are much for him who falls in love.’</p>

I"€<p>In life, very few things are to remain devout to us till the end. The observance we dig out of our reads and proficiency we attain from living our day to day life and of course, our dog isnâ€™t exceptional if we possess one. Life is full of combats if one wants to excel.</p>

<p>I must say Michelle Obamaâ€™s â€˜Becomingâ€™ should be on their top shelf, if one esteem reading is one of the royal courses to succeed.Â I was pretty delighted to get my own paperback a month back andÂ unveilingÂ some words about it here, is indeed a glorious feeling.
As I started turning pages, I became nigh to her character. The voyage through the words was likewiseÂ deliberationÂ of, I ever craved in life. Most of us want a simple and fulfilled life without much of an adventure. So does Michelle Obama being a typical middle class, studious girl, who struggled, but in such manner that aspires people.Â Michelle portrayed herself as a stubborn and ambitious child right from her Kindergarten classes. She showed her early potency in music, and started taking lessons at home. Very few of us can take our failures in good spirit and sheâ€™s noÂ exception,Â butÂ what made her stronger is her conviction and passion to start again with every failure.
Michelle is a family person and gives high priority to her family and friends as she believes, they are her backbone. Each person around her holds a remarkable place in her life. She encourages them with a great sense of love, care, and respect.</p>

<p>As most of the school kidâ€™s dream of pursuing their higher graduate degree at Princeton University, New Jersey. She started preparing for it during her school days,Â but her road to Princeton wasnâ€™t easy as people around her speculated that, sheâ€™s not a Princeton material. Despite all the demurral, her day and night of foreseer hard work and ambition to crack Princeton is quite interesting to read. Let me quote her words here, â€œfailure is feeling long before itâ€™s an actual result.â€ And she didnâ€™t let the failure feeling overpower her.
After Princeton, she was bound for Harvard law school, which turned out to be her lifeâ€™s greatest achievement. Love of her parents, faith of her teachers, the music from her south side, her feeling was no less than climbing a mountain. Just then someone knocked on the door in her life, a law student who was busy climbing his own ladder. Like her, heâ€™s colored and from Harvard other than that, the name which Michelle Obama writes as odd one Barack Hussein Obama. They got married in 1992AD with complete traditional culture. Like all the love stories it has its own ups and downs, but the moment they share their fondness, oversight and compassion plays a vital role in making this a great love story. Honestly, I wonâ€™t say itâ€™s like Disneyâ€™s fairy tale,Â but more like a corporate fairy tale. Both are attracted to each other and forÂ them,Â theÂ relationship is most valuable. Bonding and giving space to each other helps to flourish this story every passing day.

<p>After marriage, kids have always been Michelle Obamaâ€™s priority. Her goal was crystal clear, to have pretty babies, a committing husband and a sweet home with dogs. But as it is said, â€˜Man makes the plan and God laughs.â€™ So her sweet home was none other than the White House. Barack Obama became president of theÂ United States in 2009 and remained till 2017 and Michelle ObamaÂ beingÂ the first lady had a great responsibility of being a good mother, a good wife and also an aspiring first lady.
Mothers are mostÂ protectiveÂ and bit more responsible towards their kids and Michelle Obama is no exception to her two very beautiful daughters Malia Ann Obama and Sasha Obama. Living in the White house never bounded their upbringing. Michelle Obama did best to become a great mother to her daughters making them unresistant to pursue their dreams. She describes her motherhood very beautifully which all the working and nonworking mothers can cherish reading in this book. Being the first lady, she never had enough time for her daughters and husband, President Barack Obama, although she organized her family to her garden well, which benefited their lifestyle and healthy eating.
Reading a book like Becoming means getting a detail about lifeâ€™s unexpected triumphs of how the U.S.Â gotÂ its next president Donald TrumpÂ (Which was unexpected for Michelle Obama). It is an inspiring and interesting story with a flavor of realism. She wrote her heart out without caring about being judged and biased. At last, I would like to finish up my review with her words that touched me most, â€˜Itâ€™s not about being perfect, itâ€™s not about where you get yourself in the end. There is power, allowing yourself to be known and heard, in owning your unique story using your authentic voice. And there is a race in being willing to know and hearing others.â€™ This for me is how we become.</p>

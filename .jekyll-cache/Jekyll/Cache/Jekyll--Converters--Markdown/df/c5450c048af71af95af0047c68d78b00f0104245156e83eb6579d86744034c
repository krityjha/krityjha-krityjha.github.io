I"ï<p>As a reader, I am assured that once in a lifetime we always wish to meet our favorite writer or the character limned in a novel. To me, Siba Shakib is one, as I always adored her writing, her way of portraying the characters not only the main protagonist but also each detail about the particular situation, place, and circumstances. Shakib is an Iranian/German filmmaker, writer, and political activist. She was born and brought up in Tehran, Iran. Shakib also worked as Music Journalist and a Radio Presenter before she came up writing her first international bestsellerÂ novel Afghanistan, Where God Only Comes to Weep,Â was published by Century, London in 2002AD has been translated into 27 different languages and received numerous recognitions and prizes for it including one of renown Peter Surava PEN Prize. This novel is a journey of three hundred and Eleven pages. She had written three novels, Samira and Samir (2005) and ESKANDAR (2009) were her second and third writings subsequently.Â </p>

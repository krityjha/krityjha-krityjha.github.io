I"Y<p>I must say, reading is much easier berth than writing but writing becomes more pleasurable when it is about something or someone you love. My first love always comes from the paperback. We never failed bonding with each other and still we are continuing as best mates.</p>

<p>Recently, I came across one extremely interesting read, â€˜SITA Warrior of Mithila â€˜(Book 2 of the Ram Chandra series) by Amish. Amish Tripathi known as, boring banker turned happy author, is passionate about writing History, Mythology and Philosophy. The Immortals of Mehula (Book 1 of the Shiva Trilogy), his debut book was bestseller. I have read all his books but SITA impelled me to speak my mind through writings. I was born and brought up in Janakpurdham also known as Milthila, the birth place of Goddess Sita, my hometown.</p>

<p>Before picking this book for my reads, yes I did judge this book by its cover. I have had  always seen Portraits of Sita as an eminently  feminine ,delicate and beautiful character but the distinctiveness I saw on the cover of SITA , as a warrior with such masculine body seemed to be fighting with bunch of well build men. I grabbed it instantly. Yes, I was pretty excited reading it that I finished all 361 pages of it in just two days. I must say, author knows how to keep readers frenzied till end. In this book, one can find all the characters from â€˜Ramayanaâ€™, which is incised in heart and soul of Hindus as Hindus been brought up reading Ramayana, watching it on TV series and some Hindus are even named after the characters of Ramayana. In SITA, one can find greater twist and turns with all characters in contrast to original Ramayana.</p>

<p>Amish never fail portraying female protagonist as strongest. In this book, he portrait female leads are not just beautiful fantasy with delicate features but they are held strong mentally and physically. His female characters are never dominated by any male character, which I love the most about his book.</p>

<p>Sita as a warrior inspired me to be strong and high-end. We as woman should not crave to be protected by other men but by ourselves. We are free to choose what we want, what we believe. The World has changed, the era is different then why canâ€™t Sita be warrior and fight for dignity by herself rather than waiting for Ram to rescue her.</p>

<p>Raavan is still there not in human but in our thoughts which we need to fight and change without asking and seeking help from Ram. Todayâ€™s Sita should be fierce, independent, earn her living and above all should protect herself.</p>

<p>While reading, Iâ€™m habituated of highlighting impacting lines on pages of the book I read and author knows how to make words more edgy and effective and his most powerful lines are usually from female protagonist. It is indeed difficult to choose but some of my favorites, I am writing here 
â€˜What matters is not the weapon but the women who wields the weapon.â€™(Samaichi)
â€˜It is said that, we came with nothing into this world and take nothing back but thatâ€™s not true we carry our Karma with us and we leave behind our reputation, our name. â€˜(Sunaina) 
â€˜Sometime too-clever-by-half plan can be backfiring. The ends justify the means. â€˜(Sita)</p>

<p>If you know Ramayana, then Sita is the goddess being bowed by every Hindus but in this book you will discover the mighty Sita, who knows how to use bow and arrow. This book definitely will jolt you with multiple blends of twist and turns or if not then youâ€™ll still love the female characters depicted by Amish.</p>

I"1<p>I must say, reading is much easier berth than writing but writing becomes more pleasurable when it is about something or someone you love. My first love always comes from the paperback. We never failed bonding with each other and still we are continuing as best mates.</p>

<p>Recently, I came across one extremely interesting read, ‘SITA Warrior of Mithila ‘(Book 2 of the Ram Chandra series) by Amish. Amish Tripathi known as, boring banker turned happy author, is passionate about writing History, Mythology and Philosophy. The Immortals of Mehula (Book 1 of the Shiva Trilogy), his debut book was bestseller. I have read all his books but SITA impelled me to speak my mind through writings. I was born and brought up in Janakpurdham also known as Milthila, the birth place of Goddess Sita, my hometown.</p>

<p>Before picking this book for my reads, yes I did judge this book by its cover. I have had  always seen Portraits of Sita as an eminently  feminine ,delicate and beautiful character but the distinctiveness I saw on the cover of SITA , as a warrior with such masculine body seemed to be fighting with bunch of well build men. I grabbed it instantly. Yes, I was pretty excited reading it that I finished all 361 pages of it in just two days. I must say, author knows how to keep readers frenzied till end.</p>
